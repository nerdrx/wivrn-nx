// Automatic bitrate control.
//
// The client acknowledges every video frame with a from_headset::feedback packet that carries,
// among others, the time the first and the last packet of that frame were received (both in the
// client clock, so their difference needs no clock offset). The fraction of a frame period spent
// receiving a frame is a direct measure of how much of the link capacity the stream is using:
//
//     utilisation = (received_last_packet - received_first_packet) / frame_period
//
// A utilisation close to (or above) 1 means the wireless link cannot deliver a frame within the
// time budget of a frame, which is exactly what "the connection lags" feels like. Frames that
// never arrive completely (no sent_to_decoder, same test the IDR handler uses) and frames that are
// decoded but dropped before ever being shown are counted as delivery failures.
//
// Two regimes coexist:
//   * gradual degradation (walking away from the router): gentle multiplicative decrease followed
//     by slow additive probing back up;
//   * acute lag spike: a deep drop, which in practice also flushes whatever queue got wedged, then
//     a fast slow-start style rebound back to the pre-drop bitrate. If congestion returns during
//     the rebound the rebound target itself is lowered (the classic ssthresh idea) so the two do
//     not oscillate.
//
// All decisions are taken from a sliding window of per-frame samples, using a high percentile so
// that a single unlucky frame does not move the bitrate. The window is flushed after every change
// so that stale samples cannot trigger a second change.
//
// On top of that, the headset reports its Wi-Fi radio state about once a second
// (from_headset::wifi_state). Frame timings are a *lagging* indicator: by the time the utilisation
// rises the packets are already late. The radio is a *leading* one — the signal starts falling a
// second or two before the rate adaptation gives up and the first packet is lost. The controller
// therefore steps down preemptively on a falling signal, while the frame timings still look fine.
// Only the trend is used: absolute dBm says nothing portable, a fall of several dB over a few
// seconds says the user is walking away from the access point. Radio input can only ever *lower*
// the bitrate; it never raises one, and it never runs while the deep-drop recovery is in charge.
//
// ======================================================================================
// Control law v2: delivered-bandwidth estimation (bitrate_mode::bbr)
// ======================================================================================
//
// Everything above is a *congestion* controller: it reacts to the link being full. It never
// learns how big the link is, so after a decrease it has to walk back up blind, one additive
// step every five seconds, and after a deep drop it rebounds towards a number it remembered
// rather than one it measured. v2 measures the link instead, the way BBR does, and derives the
// bitrate from that estimate. It is selected per session and runs inside this same object: the
// ceilings, the floor, the two switches, the frame ring that joins the per-stream feedback into
// one frame, the acute lost/late detection and the radio trend are all shared and all still
// apply — only the function that turns a window of samples into a bitrate differs.
//
// --- The delivery rate sample ---------------------------------------------------------
// The headset says, per frame, when the first and the last packet of that frame arrived. The
// server knows how many bytes it put on the wire for that frame (see on_frame_bytes: the
// encoder reports them from its send path, parity shards included, which is exactly the unit
// set_bitrate is expressed in). One frame therefore yields
//
//     delivery_rate = 8 * frame_bytes / (received_last - received_first)
//
// which is a *lower bound* on the capacity of the bottleneck: those bytes really did get
// through in that time. Both timestamps are in the client clock, so no clock offset is needed.
//
// --- App-limited samples --------------------------------------------------------------
// A lower bound is only useful if the sender was actually trying. BBR calls a sample
// "app-limited" when the application had nothing more to send, and refuses to let such a
// sample lower its estimate. Here the analogous case is a frame that is small compared to what
// the link could have carried in that window: a nearly static scene produces a 5 kB P-frame
// that goes out in one micro-burst and lands in a few hundred microseconds, and 5 kB over
// 300 us reads as 130 Mbit/s of "capacity" that is really one Wi-Fi TXOP measured with a
// stopwatch. Feeding that to a *maximum* filter is worse than useless, so a sample is only
// admitted when the frame occupied the link for a meaningful stretch of the frame period:
// see app_limited_wire_fraction. Frames below it are still used for utilisation, loss and
// lateness — they just say nothing about capacity.
//
// Packet pacing (see shard_pacer) is the other half of the same story, and the reason the
// threshold is expressed relative to the *paced* window rather than to a frame period. Pacing
// deliberately spreads a frame over ~40% of a frame period whatever its size, so with pacing on
// the measured delivery rate saturates at about bitrate / window: the sender, not the link, is
// what limits it. That is a genuine app-limited regime and it is handled the way BBR handles
// its own: the sample is still a valid lower bound, the estimate climbs to it, and the
// controller keeps raising the bitrate until something else stops it — a ceiling, or the link
// actually filling up, at which point the receive span stretches past the paced window and the
// samples become real capacity measurements again. Pacing therefore costs v2 the ability to
// measure headroom it is not using, which is precisely what pacing is for.
//
// --- The queueing signal, and why it is not an RTT --------------------------------------
// BBR's second state variable is min_rtt, and the ratio of the current RTT to it is how it
// notices a queue building before anything is lost. A real RTT is not available here without
// a clock offset: send_begin is in the server clock and received_first_packet in the client's,
// and while the server does run a clock offset estimator, it needs seconds to converge, it is
// reset on every path failover, and its residual error is of the same order as the queueing
// delay that would have to be detected. Depending on it would make the controller useless
// exactly when adaptation matters most — the first seconds of a session, and right after a
// failover. So no absolute delay is used anywhere in v2.
//
// The obvious offset-free substitute is the wire span itself, received_last - received_first,
// compared against its own windowed minimum. That is wrong, and worth spelling out: a wire
// span is a *transmission* time, not a propagation delay. It is proportional to the number of
// bytes in the frame, so it grows whenever the bitrate is raised or the scene gets busy, with
// no queue anywhere — on an unpaced link the span at 50 Mbit/s is simply twice the span at
// 25 Mbit/s. A min filter on it would read every increase as congestion.
//
// Dividing by the bytes removes exactly that dependency, and what is left is the delivery rate
// the estimator already computes. So the queueing signal is
//
//     slowdown = windowed_max_bandwidth / (recent delivery rate)
//
// — the link handing over the same bytes more slowly than the best it has managed in the last
// ten seconds. It is scale-free (a bigger frame takes proportionally longer and the ratio does
// not move), it needs no clock offset, and it is the same quantity in both pacing regimes: with
// pacing on both numerator and denominator sit at bitrate / window until the link becomes the
// bottleneck, at which point only the denominator falls. Both sides are high percentiles, so a
// single slow frame does not trigger it, and it is ignored during the startup ramp, where the
// bitrate is deliberately climbing faster than the measurement can follow.
//
// --- The state machine -------------------------------------------------------------------
// startup: gain 1.25, doubling-ish growth until the bandwidth estimate stops improving for
//          three consecutive rounds — BBR's STARTUP and its bandwidth-plateau exit.
// steady:  gain 0.85. The gap to 1 is the headroom that keeps the bottleneck queue empty; it
//          is also what leaves room for the P-frame/I-frame variance a video encoder produces
//          around its nominal bitrate.
// probe:   once every eight seconds, one round at gain 1.10, so that capacity that came back
//          (the user walked towards the router again) is rediscovered instead of waiting for
//          the ten second maximum filter to age out. Skipped while the radio says the link is
//          degrading: probing into a fall is how v1's blind additive increase used to hurt.
//          A probe is a deliberate overshoot — on a link that is already the bottleneck it
//          will by construction stretch the frames past a frame period — so while one is
//          running its own overshoot is not read as congestion. Only frames actually lost or
//          dropped are, those are never worth a probe. Returning to steady right afterwards
//          is the drain, and it happens without waiting out the steady interval.
// backoff: on the same acute signals v1 treats as congestion — frames that never arrived,
//          frames decoded but never shown, utilisation at the ceiling — or on the slowdown
//          above, the maximum filter is first capped to what the link is measurably doing
//          right now (its ten second memory has just been proven stale by an event rather
//          than aged out), and the bitrate goes to 0.7 times that. The state returns to
//          steady, whose 0.85 gain brings the bitrate back up one second later: the
//          undershoot is BBR's DRAIN, there to empty the queue that built up, not a new
//          operating point.
// A degrading radio trend forces steady with gain 0.75 and blocks probing, reusing the same
// radio_hold flag v1 uses to block its additive increase.
